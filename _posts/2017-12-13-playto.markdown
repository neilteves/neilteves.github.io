A 2D problem-solving / platformer game centered around a grumpy lump of playdough who just wants to be happy. The playdough can shift into three different shapes: a ball thatâ€™s able to roll side to side, an invulnerable block that concentrates its mass so it can drop down, and a longer stick shape that allows the playdough to climb up to higher platforms or form bridges across gaps.
