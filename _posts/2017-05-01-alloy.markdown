A web application built for the students of the University of Hawaii: Manoa with the purpose of encouraging and supporting collaborations. This application creates an online space similar to social media sites where students of different departments and of varying knowledge and skills are able to share projects they are working on and come together with other students to improve upon a current project or to even create something new and profound.
