A web application built for the students of the University of Hawaii: Manoa with the purpose of encouraging and supporting collaborations. This application creates an online space similar to social media sites where students of different departments and of varying knowledge and skills are able to share projects they are working on and come together with other students to improve upon a current project or to even create something new and profound.

My responsibilities during the creation of Alloy mainly consisted of coding the search function. It was a bit difficult at first because my understanding of Meteor and MongoDB were very limited. It took me sometime to get a grip of the new language, although that grip was still very minimal. The search function is created reactively, meaning that the website does not have to change webpages when a search query is entered. All actions happen within the same webpage. Itâ€™s a nice feature to keep the code clean, less pages means less code to keep track of in the program. The search function is also equipped with an autofill capability that pulls from a collection of entered projects skills, associated attributes that are related to a project.

Additional features I contributed to included the creation of the Administrator users capabilities and associated admin web pages.  These new features were created during the second half of the year I had been working on the website.  My understanding of Meteor and MongoDB were far greater and these new pages were much more user friendly.  For further details on the features I contributed to the Alloy website please visit [Alloy updates][alloy-updates].
