A 2D problem-solving / platformer game centered around a grumpy lump of “play dough” who wants to be happy. The play dough can shift into three different shapes: a ball that’s able to roll side to side, an invulnerable block that concentrates his mass so he can drop down, and a longer stick shape that lets the play dough climb up to higher platforms or form bridges across gaps.
