A 2D arcade game where you play as a fluffy little cloud collecting stars and hearts to get the high score, while avoiding grumpy thunderclouds.  Accumulus is a simple time killer where you can compare highscores with friends and other players globally through Google leaderboards.  

This is my first attempt at publishing a mobile game.  All the programming and art was created by me.  The game engine I used was Unity3D.

Check out the [Accumulus][accumulus-playstore] at the Google Playstore.
